**Generate, check strength, and verify the security of your passwords with this all-in-one password utility built with Python and Flask.**

PyPass is a simple yet powerful web application designed to help you manage your password security effectively. It provides a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface for all your password-related needs.

## ‚ú® Features

PyPass comes with three core features to enhance your online security:

* **üîê Password Generator:** Create strong, random, and customizable passwords. You can specify the length and include or exclude uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
* **üí™ Strength Checker:** Get instant feedback on the strength of your passwords. The visual strength bar and clear labels (Weak, Fair, Strong, Very Strong) help you understand how secure your password is.
* **üõ°Ô∏è Breach Check:** Verify if your password has been exposed in any known data breaches using the 'Have I Been Pwned?' API. This feature helps you avoid using compromised passwords.

## Containerization
* This application is also containerized for ease of use and testing on your local machine! Which makes it easier for the user to tear up or down the application without having to manually uninstall all the dependencies / packages in the event you want to remove the application

* **Steps to Build and Run**
    1. Go to the current working directory of the repository aka. pypass/
      ```bash

      git clone https://github.com/CyberPanther232/pypass.git; cd pypass

      ```
    3. Next, run the command below to build the container on your machine!
      ```bash
       # Without elevated privileges
        sudo docker build -t "pypass" ./

       # With elevated privileges
        sudo docker build -t "pypass" ./
       
      ```

    5. After that, run the command below (set the left port to whatever port you want to open on your machine)
     ```bash
         # This will start and run the container detached
        docker run -p 5000:5000 --name PYPASS -d
     ```

     4. Finally, go to a web browser and either type localhost:5000 (or whatever other port number you may use) or the local IP address associated with your machine ex. (192.168.1.2:5000)
 
     5. Then you're done! Enjoy!
